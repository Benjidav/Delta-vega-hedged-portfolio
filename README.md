# Delta-Vega-hedging project
From the data provided (stock history, column B) in the file *Dataset*, we want to create the portfolio history of replication of a european call with maturity on **31/12/2018**, strike **K = 6**. To do that, we are going to use a synthetic replication portfolio formed from a stock, cash and another K6.5 european call option (to neutralize the effect of the volatility on the price of the option).
